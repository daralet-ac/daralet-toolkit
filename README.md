# Daralet Toolkit

Daralet Toolkit is the official [Decal](https://www.decaldev.com/) plugin for players on the Daralet server. It opens a window in
the game with:

- **Config**: settings profiles. Every setting the plugin has (its windows and where they are, every tab's options,
  your loot profiles and hotbars) is kept in a profile, and each character picks its own, so your main and your mule
  can each have their own set up, or share one. Save a profile to a file to keep it or give it to a friend, and add one
  from a file. Client UI Override puts the plugin's windows in place of the game's: its toolbar buttons, and the bank
  and corpse windows. Hide game UI hides all of the game's UI and the plugin's windows for screenshots, and brings them
  back, with a key (F1 to start) or `/dap hideui` and `/dap showui`. Tick Keep plugin windows to hide only the game's UI.
- **World**: a map of Dereth with Daralet's towns, dungeons, lifestones, portals and more. It shows where you are, where
  your fellowship is (unless they're in a dungeon), and an arrow window that points you anywhere on the map, or follows a
  fellow. Search for a place by name, or right-click the map. Inside, the Dungeon window maps the dungeon you're in,
  drawn from the game's own files: your floor bright and the others dimmed, following you and turning as you turn. It
  greys out the rooms you've been in (remembered for each character), marks the portals, corpses, chests, NPCs and
  monsters on your floor in those rooms, and draws the way out, or the way to anything you right-click.
- **Social**: your allegiance (rank, followers, monarch, patron and vassals, and the XP passed between you, with Swear,
  Break and Kick), your fellowship (its members' health, stamina and mana, its Leader, Dismiss, Open, Recruit, Quit and
  Disband buttons, Create Fellowship when you aren't in one, and a small window that stays on screen while you play,
  with each member's level, Combat Focus, distance and buffs if you like), Find a group, your friends (who's online,
  Appear Offline, and invites and tells from a right-click) and your squelches. Click a name to select that player.
- **Combat**: what you're fighting: its health, stamina and mana, every buff and debuff on it, and its threat table (who
  it wants to attack), with a window that stays on screen too. And hotbars: drag potions, kits, weapons or spells onto them
  and use or cast them with a click or a hotkey. Each bar can have as many slots, rows and pages as you like, its own colours, and
  shows cooldowns and how many uses an item has left.
- **Loot**: a looter with loot profiles (sets of rules) you write yourself, using the same filters as the market search. Each character picks
  a loot profile, and you can swap them at any time. When you open a corpse or a chest, it can loot automatically, ask first, or just point
  out what matches. It can also salvage what you tell it to. A rule can ask for how well a stat rolled rather than the stat
  itself, and can mark what it finds with a coloured frame and a symbol. Loot window (on the Config tab) shows corpses
  and chests in the plugin's window instead of the game's.
- **Inventory**: the packs you carry, anywhere, and your bank while it's open, as a list or a grid of icons. Move items
  between packs, and deposit, withdraw, sort and search without typing `/bank` commands. Bank window (on the Config tab)
  opens your bank in the plugin's own window instead of the game's. Loot highlights shows which of your items your loot rules would mark.
- **Market**: your listings, sales and expired items, with buttons for the Market Broker (list, cancel, claim), plus a
  search of the whole market like the website's.
- **Arena**: queue, challenge, leave and watch duels, with your ratings and the latest results.
- **Leaderboards**: the website's leaderboards: level, arena, capstones, deaths and more.

Type `/dap` to open and close the window, or set a key or a button you can put anywhere for it (the Config tab).
Hover over almost anything for a tooltip saying what it does.

## What you need

- **Decal 2.9.8.3.** Older versions, including "Decal 3.0" (which reports itself as 2.9.7.5), can't run this plugin.
  The Decal agent's title bar shows which version you have.
- **[UtilityBelt](https://utilitybelt.gitlab.io/) and
  [UtilityBelt.Service 2.2.12](https://gitlab.com/utilitybelt/utilitybelt.service/-/releases/v2.2.12).** Daralet Toolkit draws
  its window with UtilityBelt.Service, which is a **separate install** from UtilityBelt itself. You need both installed,
  but you don't have to use UtilityBelt's own features.
- **A Daralet account.** The plugin only works on the Daralet server.

## Installing

1. **Update Decal if you need to.** Open the Decal agent (the icon in your system tray) and look at the version in its
   title bar. If it isn't 2.9.8.x, install [Decal 2.9.8.3](https://www.decaldev.com/) over it. Install the Visual C++ 2017
   (x86) runtime it links to as well. Your other plugins keep working.
2. **Install UtilityBelt** from [utilitybelt.gitlab.io](https://utilitybelt.gitlab.io/) if you don't have it.
3. **Close the game and the Decal agent** (right-click its tray icon, **Exit**).
4. **Download `DaraletToolkit-Setup-x.y.z.exe`** from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/daralet-ac/daralet-toolkit/releases/latest) (under **Assets**) and run it.
   It checks your Decal version, installs UtilityBelt.Service if you don't have it (tick the box it shows), puts
   `DaraletToolkit.dll` in `C:\Games\Decal Plugins\Daralet Toolkit\` and adds it to Decal for you, ticked.
5. **Start the game** through Decal and log in. Type `/dap` to open the window.

Afterwards the Decal agent should show **Daralet Toolkit** under **Plugins** and **UtilityBelt.Service** under **Services**, both
ticked. (UtilityBelt itself shows under **Network Filters**.)

### Installing by hand

If you'd rather not run the installer:

1. Do steps 1 and 2 above.
2. **Install UtilityBelt.Service**, even if you already have UtilityBelt: UtilityBelt's installer doesn't include it.
   Close the game and the Decal agent, then run
   [UtilityBelt.Service-Installer-2.2.12.exe](https://gitlab.com/utilitybelt/utilitybelt.service/-/releases/v2.2.12/downloads/packages/UtilityBelt.Service-Installer-2.2.12.exe).
3. **Download `DaraletToolkit.dll`** from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/daralet-ac/daralet-toolkit/releases/latest) (under **Assets**).
4. **Put it somewhere it can stay**, for example `C:\Games\Decal Plugins\Daralet Toolkit\`. Decal
   loads the file from wherever you put it, so don't leave it in your Downloads folder.
5. **Add it to Decal.** In the Decal agent, click **Add**, then **Browse**, and pick `DaraletToolkit.dll`.
6. **Make sure Daralet Toolkit is ticked** under **Plugins** in the Decal agent, then start the game.

## Updating

When a new version is out, Daralet Toolkit says so in chat when you log in, and an **Update** button appears at the top of
the `/dap` window. Click it for the download page.

Close the game and the Decal agent, and run the new `DaraletToolkit-Setup-x.y.z.exe` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/daralet-ac/daralet-toolkit/releases/latest). It replaces the old version
wherever it is, including a `DaraletToolkit.dll` you added to Decal by hand. Your settings are kept.

By hand instead: download the new `DaraletToolkit.dll`, close the game, replace the old `DaraletToolkit.dll` with the new one (same
name, same folder), then start the game again. You don't need to add it to Decal again.

**Coming from Daralet (v0.6.0 or older)?** The plugin was called Daralet, its file `Daralet.dll` (`DaraletPlayer.dll`
in v0.1.0). The installer takes care of it. By hand: put `DaraletToolkit.dll` in the same folder, then in the Decal
agent click **Add**, **Browse**, and pick `DaraletToolkit.dll`: it replaces the old entry, since Decal knows them as the
same plugin. Then delete the old dll. Your settings are kept: the plugin moves them to their new folder the first time
it starts.

## Your settings

Everything the plugin keeps is in

    Documents\Decal Plugins\Daralet Toolkit

on your computer: window positions, display options and loot profiles in `settings.json` (the Default settings
profile), other settings profiles in `Settings Profiles`, which character uses which in `profiles.json`, profiles saved
with To file in `Settings Exports`, loot profile files in `Loot Profiles`, the downloaded map and places in
`world-data`, and `log.txt`. To start fresh, close the game and delete `settings.json`, or make a New profile on the
Config tab.

To move your loot profiles to another computer, or share them with a friend, use **Export** on the Loot tab and **Import**
on the other end.

## Things to know

- **Loot:** the looter starts off. If you also use VirindiTank's looter, only turn one of them on, or they'll fight over
  the same corpse. Salvaging needs an Ust in your packs.
- **Market:** listing, cancelling and claiming only work when you're near a Market Broker (the market stand in
  Hebian-To). Searching works from anywhere. Market search and leaderboards come from the Daralet website, so they need
  an internet connection, the same as the website.
- **Toolbar buttons:** tick Inventory, Quests, Map or Character under **Client UI Override** on the Config tab, and the
  game toolbar's backpack, Contracts (quill) or Map (compass) button, or the Character Information pack beside it (yellow
  or red when you're overburdened), opens the plugin's window instead of the game's panel. The plugin draws its own copy of the button over the game's, lit while its window is open. The
  game's own keys for those panels still open the game's.
- **Map:** the map and its places update themselves: each time the plugin starts it checks GitHub for a newer map
  image and `locations.xml`, and downloads them if they've changed (into `Documents\Decal Plugins\Daralet Toolkit\world-data`).
  **Show...** on the World tab says what it found and has a **Check for map updates** button. Without an internet
  connection the plugin uses the ones it came with. To use your own copy of the map image instead, put a square
  `dereth-map.png` next to `DaraletToolkit.dll`. It has to keep the original's layout. To use your own places, do the same
  with a GoArrow-style `locations.xml`. Files next to the dll always win over downloaded ones.

## Problems

- **"Failed to register plugin" when adding the dll:** Decal is older than 2.9.8. See step 1 of Installing.
- **Daralet Toolkit isn't in Decal's list, or isn't ticked:** run the installer again, or add it by hand (Installing by hand,
  step 5) and tick it.
- **"Could not load file or assembly 'UtilityBelt.Service'" in chat or `log.txt`, or no UtilityBelt bar in game:**
  UtilityBelt.Service isn't installed. Run the installer again and tick the UtilityBelt.Service box, or see Installing
  by hand, step 2. Having UtilityBelt alone isn't enough. (Decal's
  **Add/Remove Plugins** window saying UtilityBelt is "Not Installed" doesn't matter: it only knows about things
  installed from that window.)
- **Nothing happens when you type `/dap`:** check that UtilityBelt.Service is under **Services** in the Decal agent, and
  that Daralet Toolkit is ticked under **Plugins**. Then restart the game.
- **A tab says the server is too old:** the server hasn't been updated for that part of the plugin yet. The rest still
  works.
- **Lines starting with `DAP2|` (or `DAP1|`) show up in chat:** those are messages from the server to the plugin, and the plugin
  normally hides them. Report it, and include `log.txt` from `Documents\Decal Plugins\Daralet Toolkit`.
- **Anything else:** errors are written to `log.txt` in `Documents\Decal Plugins\Daralet Toolkit`. Include that file when you
  report a problem.

## Uninstalling

If you used the installer, uninstall **Daralet Toolkit (Decal plugin)** from Windows' **Installed apps** (Add or remove
programs). It takes Daralet Toolkit out of Decal and asks whether to delete your settings and loot profiles too.

If you installed by hand: in the Decal agent, select **Daralet Toolkit** and click **Remove** (or just untick it). Then delete
`DaraletToolkit.dll`, and `Documents\Decal Plugins\Daralet Toolkit\` if you don't want your settings any more.

## For developers

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for how the plugin is built and how it talks to the server. In short:

```bash
dotnet build DaraletPlayer.sln -c Release
```

```bash
dotnet test tests/DaraletPlayer.Tests/DaraletPlayer.Tests.csproj
```

Both dlls end up in `bin/`. `DaraletToolkit.Loader.dll` is for development only: add it as a Decal network filter
(with Daralet Toolkit unticked) and it reloads the plugin every time you rebuild. Players only need `DaraletToolkit.dll`.

### Releasing a new version

1. Raise `<Version>` in `src/DaraletPlayer/DaraletPlayer.csproj` and merge it into `main`.
2. Tag that commit `v` and the version (`v0.5.0`) and push the tag.
3. The **Release** workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) builds and tests the plugin, builds the installer from
   `installer/DaraletToolkit.iss`, and publishes the release with `DaraletToolkit-Setup-<version>.exe` and
   `DaraletToolkit.dll`. It stops if
   the tag and `<Version>` disagree. Run it by hand from the Actions tab to get the installer as a run artifact without
   releasing anything, to try it first.

To build the installer yourself, install [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php), do a Release build, then run
`iscc /DAppVersion=0.5.0 installer\DaraletToolkit.iss`. It's written to `out\`.

### License

Daralet Toolkit is free software under the [GNU General Public License, version 3](LICENSE) or later: you can use, change and
share it, and if you share a changed version you share its source too, under the same license. [NOTICE](NOTICE) adds a
permission to combine it with Decal, UtilityBelt.Service and the game client, and lists the files in here that aren't
ours (Decal's dlls, the game's pictures, the map drawn from its dat files, GoArrow's places), which keep their own terms.

### Publishing a new map or places

Both Daralet plugins (this one and Daralet Admin) download the map image and `locations.xml` from this repository's
[`world-data` release](https://github.com/daralet-ac/daralet-toolkit/releases/tag/world-data). To update them for
everyone, without a new plugin:

1. Change `src/DaraletPlayer/Resources/locations.xml` or `src/DaraletPlayer/Resources/dereth-map.png` (keep the map
   2048x2048 and laid out the same) and merge it into `main`.
2. The **World data** workflow (`.github/workflows/world-data.yml`) uploads both files and a `manifest.json` of their
   hashes to the release. It can also be run by hand from the Actions tab.
3. Players get them the next time the plugin starts, or straight away with **Check for map updates**.

The release is a pre-release with a fixed tag, so it never shows up as the plugin's latest release. Don't edit it by
hand: the workflow replaces its files each time. Daralet Admin builds in the same files, so copy them over there too when
you next release it (it downloads them anyway).
